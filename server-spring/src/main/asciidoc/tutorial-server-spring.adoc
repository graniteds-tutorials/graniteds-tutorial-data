The server application is a Spring service which implements basic CRUD operations on user accounts in an in-memory HSQL database.
The updates on the persistent entities are dispatched to other clients though a messaging destination.

The necessary configuration for GraniteDS is relatively easy and consists in:

* adding a listener in +web.xml+ to bootstrap GraniteDS when the application starts,
* adding a Spring dispatcher servlet to handle remoting requests,
* adding a Gravity asynchronous messaging servlet to handle long-polling connections,
* declaring GraniteDS in the Spring application context,
* declaring a messaging destination in the Spring application context

The first important file is the web application +web.xml+ which contains the basic Spring and GraniteDS setup:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
----
include::{srcdir}/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=webxml-spring]
----

And the basic GraniteDS setup (bootstrap servlet listener, remoting servlet and asynchronous messaging servlet):

[source,xml,indent=0]
.main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
----
include::{srcdir}/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[tags=webxml-graniteds]
----
<1> GraniteDS bootstrap servlet listener
<2> Force the creation of an HTTP session, which is required for advanced data conflicts management.
	This filter is generally useless with real-world applications: authentication forces the creation
	of the session.
<3> Url mapping of the dispatcher servlet for GraniteDS, +/graniteamf/*+ is the recommended default
<4> Url mapping of the asynchronous servlet for GraniteDS, +/gravityamf/*+ is the recommended default

The actual Spring application context is defined in +application-context.xml+, the declaration of GraniteDS simply
consists in the +graniteds+ XML namespace declaration:

[source,xml,indent=0]
.main/resources/application-context.xml
----
include::{srcdir}/main/resources/application-context.xml[tags=namespace]
----

And the following bean, which registers GraniteDS in the Spring context. It declares that the remoting is using the Tide API,
and defines the url mapping +/\*+ meaning that all requests on the dispatcher servlet, i.e. on +/data/graniteamf/*+ will
be routed to GraniteDS. This is the recommended default.

[[server.config]]
[source,xml,indent=0]
.main/resources/application-context.xml
----
include::{srcdir}/main/resources/application-context.xml[tags=graniteds-config]
----

Next we have to declare the data messaging destination (see the <<client.destination,client application>> where the matching
client object is created):

[[server.destination]]
.main/resources/application-context.xml
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{srcdir}/main/resources/application-context.xml[tags=messaging-destination]
----

The data model is a standard JPA entity with a few particularities:

.main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/data/entities/Account.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{modelsrcdir}/main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/data/entities/Account.java[tags=entity]
----
<1> The +DataPublishListener+ entity listener tracks update events on the entity and should be used in conjunction with
the +@DataEnabled+ annotations on services (see below).
<2> The entity must be +Serializable+.
<3> It's recommended (though not mandatory) that the entity uses optimistic locking with a numeric +@Version+ property.
This is necessary for proper concurrent modifications detection.
<4> It's recommended (though again not mandatory) that the entity has a persistent +uid+ property which is not the database
primary key. The goal is to have a unique key on the entity instance during its full lifecycle (from the client to the
 service and the database, and back). Usually this +uid+ will be initialized by the client (it's handled automatically by
 the framework).
<5> Bean validation annotations can be used and will be propagated by the code generator to the client classes.
<6> The +@Include+ annotation can be used to specify computed properties which are not persistent but should be serialized
with the entity and will be evaluated on the server during serialization.

The service is a simple Spring bean which implements the following interface:

.main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/data/services/AccountService.java
[source,java,indent=0]
----
include::{modelsrcdir}/main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/data/services/AccountService.java[tags=service]
----
<1> The service interface is annotated with +@RemoteDestination+ to enable remote access from the client.
<2> The service interface is annotated with +@DataEnabled+ to indicate GDS that it has to track and send updates made on entities
during the execution of service methods. Updates will be sent on the specified topic, here +dataTopic+.

Here is the bean implementation:

[source,java,indent=0]
.main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/data/services/AccountServiceImpl.java
----
include::{srcdir}/main/java/org/graniteds/tutorial/data/services/AccountServiceImpl.java[tags=service-impl]
----
<1> Note the use of +merge+ to apply the changes coming from the client which are detached entities.
<2> The method +findByFilter+ has a specific signature +Page(Map, PageInfo)+ and implements the necessary support for
server-side paging and sorting. See the class +AccountSearch+ for the actual implementation using the JPA Criteria API.

NOTE: It would also be possible to directly use a Spring Data JPA repository instead of implementing these methods
manually.
